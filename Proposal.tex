\section{Aims}

Archiving project and research works of students \& teachers of our university and also provide project \& personal profile analyzing service.



\section{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
\item We will collect data about project and research works of all the teachers and students.
\item The key thing will be the review system for each and every project. We will build an automated system using machine learning algorithms which will determine the project strength by the reviews from the project organizer \& other people who will be seeing it online.
\item When the project will be uploaded the user will have to provide a precise description of the project and we shall use the project review to determine his profile strength also by using machine learning algorithms. So these will be our key objectives for this project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Importance}

As we do not have any access to the previous works done by the students of the department we will be able to have easy access to the works done by the people of the department. Sometimes we might get puzzled if it is a literal good work to review and might get disappointed after watching the whole project. The review system will resolve the problem and predict if it should be broken down deep inside or not. So this complete project will be saving the time of the reviewer.

\section{Project Deliverables}


The whole process will be working like it is shown in the Figure~\ref{m42}. Ultimately we will be building a website where the students \& teachers will be able to upload their research projects \& works in with a brief description. The student project descriptions must be approved by the project organizer before the projects public availability. After the completion of the uploading process and public availability people will write reviews about the projects with ratings. We will take the description \& the reviews to calculate the project strength to calculate the project strength \& profile strength of that very user.

To test our project, the user will have to upload a significant amount of projects with brief descriptions and collect review from other people to see the actual outcome.
